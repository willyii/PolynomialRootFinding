# PolynomialRootFinding

### 10/03/2020
- Finished GCD for two polynomial
- Pass the test of GCD
- Move some function into util namespace
- Finished square free decomposition
- Finished simple test case of decomposition
- Finished some complicated case for square free decomposition

### 10/05/2020
- Finished the basic operator for ceof and Poly
- Reformated the code, abstract the isolate class and the other class should inherated from this one

### 10/06/2020
- Add Monic function to poly, make it robust to the really close roots
- Finished budan's theorem based root isolation
- Pass the simple tests for the polynomial with no duplicated roots.

### TODO
- Make the Newtown Method robust to the no root condition
- Combine the decomposition with the root finding.
- Make the root finding process into thread level.

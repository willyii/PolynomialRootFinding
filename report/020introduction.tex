\section{Introduction}

One of the most fundamental scientific computation is to computing the real
roots of polynomials. For the polynomials with low order, like quadratic or
cubic, we can using formula to get roots directly. However, according to the 
Abelâ€“Ruffini theorem\cite{Abel-Ruffini}, there is no solution in radicals to general 
polynomial equations of degree of five or higher with arbitrary coefficients. 
Therefore, general root-finding algorithms are needed for general polynomials.

However, the usual root-finding algorithms, like Newton Method, cannot generally
certify having found all real roots. Especially, if such algorithms does not
find any root, one cannot know if there is real roots or not. In order to get
all real roots, real-root isolation is useful. Real-root isolation can generate
intervals, which contain only one real root of the polynomial, so that no real
root will be missed.

\section{Contributions}

%We propose to develop machine learning models to classify imbalanced data and anomalies from BGP traffic dataset. \cite{Xianbo19} \cite{Wu19} We also expected to compare performance between different models over varied dataset.

%We plan to benchmark our approach against the SVM approach by Allahdadi \etal \cite{Allahdadi2017ADetection} and the GRU and LSTM approaches by Li \etal \cite{li2019machine}. 

Our planned contributions to this body of knowledge are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    %\item Analyze dataset to manage feature engineering which helps to detect imbalanced data and anomalies.
    \item Re-implement both semi-supervised and fully supervised classification models to detect anomalies.
    \item Evaluate the generalization error of the SVM approach by Allahdadi \etal \cite{Allahdadi2017ADetection}, and the GRU and LSTM approaches by Li \etal \cite{li2019machine} on different datasets.
    \item Develop and implement a novel model for anomaly detection that has improved generalizability between datasets.
    \item Possibly perform feature engineering to improve generalizability of models between different datasets.
    % \item Compare detection results with referenced papers applied similar models.
    % \item Validate models with modern data or different distributed data.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion} \label{conclusion}

In this project, we implement a real-roots isolation program based on
Budan’s theorem and continued fraction. Besides that, we also use several
methods to optimize the program, like Taylor Expansion for polynomial shift and
interval arithmetic for error control.

Then we compare the running time of these two algorithms. It is noticeable that
when there are conjugate complex roots, Budan’s theorem will take longer. And
continued fraction methods perform worse when polynomials have several large
real roots due to slow shifts of polynomials. This can be optimized in the
future.

With the application of interval arithmetic, our program becomes more robust to
the errors from inexact computation and representation, although it is not
perfect for all of the cases. We analyze the conditions that might
cause failure of the program and find that the magnitude of coefficients might
affect error's change during the processes of $GCD$ and $remainder$ computation.
If the coefficients are large, the errors might become not ignorable and affect
the accuracy of factors. Which might finally lead to failure of our program.

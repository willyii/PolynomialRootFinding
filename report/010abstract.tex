\section{Abstract}

Computing the real roots of univariate polynomial is one of fundamental tasks in
numeric and computer algebra. Usual root-finding algorithms for computing the
real roots of a polynomial may produce some real roots, but cannot generally
certify having found all real roots.

In this project, we implemented a basic real roots isolation program based on
Budan's Theorem and Continued Fraction Method. Both methods are developed from 
Descartes' rule of signs. Then we compare the running time of these two methods
and get the conclusion that TODO.

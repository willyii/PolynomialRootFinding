\section{Abstract}

Computing the real roots of univariate polynomial is one of fundamental tasks in
numeric and computer algebra. Usual root-finding algorithms for computing the
real roots of a polynomial may produce some real roots, but cannot generally
certify having found all real roots.

In this project, we implemented a basic real roots isolation program based on
Budan's Theorem and Continued Fraction Method. Both methods are developed from 
Descartes' rule of signs. Then I optimize the program with my best effort and 
compare the running time of these two methods. Beside that, I also analyzed the
conditions that make this program fail.

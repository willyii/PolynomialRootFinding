 abstract = {In this paper, we will give three different (including revamped versions of Horowitz's and Musser's) algorithms for computing the SQFR decomposition of polynomials in R[x]. Some algorithm analysis will be carried out to show the (asymptotic) superiority of the algorithm we propose (last of the three).},
